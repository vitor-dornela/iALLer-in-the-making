This model predicts failures in a dataset by analyzing 50 variables. Each variable contains a timestamp for every second, over a period of 5 months, which results in more than 200,000 values per variable. In addition, the dataset includes a variable indicating the operational status, either NORMAL or ABNORMAL.
